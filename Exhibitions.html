            Biology and Medicine
        </h3>
        <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
